# Project4: Advanced Lane Finding

In this project, the ultimate goal is to locate drivable road within the current lane, using traditional computer vision technology, including: camera calibration, image undistortion, perspective transformation, gradient and color threshold, curve fitting etc.

#Camera Calibration
The process can be found in p4_progress.ipynb 2nd cell, at def cam_cal(). After finding all corners by cv2.findChessboardCorners(gray, (9,6), None), points on image plane and world space are found. Then, cv2.calibrateCamera(objpoints, imgpoints, img_size,None,None) is used to get camera calibration matrix. It is saved later with perspective transformation matrix as pickle.

The following is calibration images before and after the process:
